# Notes on "de novo assembly" lecture

(please add notes from whiteboard if you want/as you can!)

Why assemble? What questions can we answer, vs variant calling?

Variant calling requires a reference genome and assembly does not

## Genome sequencing vs rnaseq vs metagenome sequencing

### Why assembly (and not variant calling?)
* VC requires a *good* reference genome (good is relative)
* assembly able to construct transcriptomes and metagenomes

### What different questions can you answer?
* VC is good at detecting small differences in a sample

## Haplotype resolution, isoforns, and strain resolution

Also: does one true answer even exist?

## Physical isolation approaches 

## Chromatin structure approaches

## Sequencing approaches

## Assembly approaches

Greedy, OLC, and De Bruijn graph/k-mer approaches.

## Black box model for assembly; validation/qc approaches

## Next steps: annotation
