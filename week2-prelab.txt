201(b) -

recap Friday - here's the workflow, here's how we ran some of it

what snakemake does: make sure all the commands are run successfully, as well as a lot more

snakemake starts, and looks at the Snakefile configuration file
this contains:

* Python code
* rules
each rule block contains:
* shell command
* potentially "needed software" 
* and more
snakemake checks that the command succeeded
will also do more, than that and that's what we'll talk about in lab 2

(list of things in the lab-1)

what we're going to do next Friday:
- re work the Snakefile to have input, output
- using an editor (nano)
